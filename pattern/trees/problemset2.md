Got it — you want **tree problems focusing on *subtree-related concepts*** (not typical path-sum or invert problems).
Here’s a **curated list** of problems from **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and **AtCoder**, categorized by the concept they test.

### **6. Advanced Tree DP (for depth in interviews/contests)**

---

### **Suggested Plan**

1. Start with **LeetCode subtree basics** — 572, 508, 663, 652.
2. Move to **sum/count subtree problems** — 1339, 337.
3. Try **contest-level subtree DFS + DP** — CF 600E, ABC 138 D.
4. Finally, go **advanced rerooting / DSU on tree** — CF 375D, ABC 222 F.
