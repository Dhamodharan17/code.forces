Great choice ðŸš€ Graph problems are **core in Codeforces** and show up often (DFS, BFS, shortest path, connected components, MST, etc.).
Iâ€™ll give you a **curated ladder** of graph problems (from easy â†’ advanced), so you can practice step by step.

## ðŸ”¹ Level 1 â€“ Basics (Representation, DFS, BFS)

1. [59E â€“ Shortest Path](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/59/E) â†’ shortest path basics.
2. [510A â€“ Fox And Snake](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/510/A) â†’ simulation on grid (intro to graph thinking).
3. [580C â€“ Kefa and Park](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/580/C) â†’ DFS on tree with constraints.
4. [1167C â€“ News Distribution](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1167/C) â†’ union-find / connected components.
5. [999E â€“ Reachability from the Capital](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/999/E) â†’ DFS + graph connectivity.

## ðŸ”¹ Level 2 â€“ Classic BFS/DFS Problems

6. [520B â€“ Two Buttons](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/520/B) â†’ BFS shortest path on implicit graph.

8. [208A â€“ Dubstep](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/208/A) â†’ string but can model adjacency.
9. [1249B â€“ Books Exchange (easy version)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1249/B1) â†’ graph cycles.
10. [1440B â€“ Sum of Medians](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1440/B) â†’ grouping graph-like.

## ðŸ”¹ Level 3 â€“ Shortest Path (Dijkstra, BFS 0-1)

11. [20C â€“ Dijkstra?](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/20/C) â†’ Dijkstra implementation.
12. [601A â€“ The Two Routes](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/601/A) â†’ complement graph BFS.
13. [25D â€“ Roads not only in Berland](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/25/D) â†’ DSU + graph connectivity.
14. [545D â€“ Queue](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/545/D) â†’ greedy but graph traversal style.
15. [229A â€“ Shifts](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/229/A) â†’ adjacency cycles.

## ðŸ”¹ Level 4 â€“ Advanced Graph Topics

16. [25A â€“ IQ Test](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/25/A) â†’ disguised as array but adjacency-style.
17. [1285C â€“ Fadi and LCM](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1285/C) â†’ math graph factorization.
18. [1000E â€“ Weights Distributing](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1000/E) â†’ BFS + rerouting edges.
19. [118E â€“ Bertown roads](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/E) â†’ edge orientation + bridges (DFS).
20. [GYM 102267B â€“ Shortest Path Queries](https://codeforces.com/gym/102267/problem/B) â†’ heavy BFS/DSU practice.

âœ… **Recommended Ladder (for you to get strong step by step):**

* **Start**: 580C, 1167C, 999E (DFS/Union-Find basics).
* **Then**: 520B, 1106D, 1249B (BFS + graph cycles).
* **Next**: 20C, 601A, 25D (shortest path + DSU).
* **Advanced**: 118E, 1000E (bridges + harder BFS).

âš¡ Pro Tip: Codeforces tags are super helpful â€” you can filter by **Graphs**, **DFS and Similar**, **Trees**, **Shortest paths**, etc.
ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to build you a **50-problem graph practice ladder** (easy â†’ medium â†’ hard) like Codeforces topic ladders?
