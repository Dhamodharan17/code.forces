Perfect 👍 string problems are **super common** on Codeforces, and they range from **easy implementation** to **advanced algorithms (KMP, Z-function, hashing, suffix arrays)**.

Here’s a **curated list of string problems** by level, so you can practice step by step 👇

---

## 🔹 Easy / Implementation

1. [59A – Word](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/59/A) → make string lowercase or uppercase.
2. [118A – String Task](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/A) → remove vowels, add dots.
3. [281A – Word Capitalization](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/281/A) → capitalize first letter.
4. [71A – Way Too Long Words](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/71/A) → abbreviate words.
5. [131A – cAPS lOCK](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/131/A) → fix wrong capitalization.

## 🔹 Medium / Classic String Manipulation

6. [266A – Stones on the Table](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/266/A) → count adjacent equal letters.
7. [144A – Arrival of the General](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/144/A) → min swaps to arrange max/min → array but string-like.
8. [337A – Puzzles](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/337/A) → substring-like windowing.
9. [520A – Pangram](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/520/A) → check if string contains all letters.
10. [43A – Football](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/43/A) → count most frequent team (like most frequent string).

## 🔹 Harder / Two Pointers & Substrings

11. [279B – Books](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/279/B) → subarray, but logic applies to substrings too.
12. [1030A – In Search of an Easy Problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1030/A) → trivial check.
13. [435A – Queue on Bus Stop](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/435/A) → simulate, string-like thinking.
14. [798A – Mike and palindrome](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/798/A) → check if one change makes a string palindrome.
15. [1080B – Margarite and the best present](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1080/B) → alternating sums, substring-like.

## 🔹 Advanced String Algorithms

16. [126B – Password](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/126/B) → KMP prefix function.
17. [432A – Choosing Teams](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/432/A) → string grouping logic.
18. [84A – Toy Army](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/84/A) → math-based but string style.
19. [271D – Good Substrings](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/271/D) → substring + hashing.
20. [118D – Caesar Cipher](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/D) → string shifting.

✅ **Recommended Path for You** (if you want to build skill):

* Start with **118A, 59A, 281A, 71A, 266A** (easy warm-up).
* Then solve **520A, 43A, 798A, 520B** (logic + simple string checks).
* Move on to **126B, 271D** (advanced: prefix-function, hashing).
