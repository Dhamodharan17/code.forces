Here are some excellent Codeforces problems to practice the various two-pointer variations:

### Same-Direction Pointers (Sliding Window)

1.  **A. Books** (Codeforces Round #171 (Div. 2) Problem B): Find the maximum number of books you can read within a given amount of time `t`. This is a classic example of a variable-sized sliding window. 
2.  **A. Flipping Game** (Codeforces Round #191 (Div. 2) Problem A): Find the maximum number of ones after flipping a single subsegment of an array. This problem can be transformed into finding the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm, which is a specialized form of a sliding window.
3.  **B. Substrings Sort** (Codeforces Round #310 (Div. 2) Problem B): A more complex string problem that can be solved with a sliding window or a related greedy approach.
4.  **A. They Are Everywhere** (Codeforces Round #277 (Div. 2) Problem C): Find the shortest contiguous subsegment that contains all distinct characters from a string. This is a perfect problem for a variable-sized sliding window.
5.  **A. Cellular Network** (Codeforces Round #304 (Div. 2) Problem C): Find the minimum of the maximum distances from a city to the nearest cellular tower. This can be solved with two pointers on two sorted arrays.

### Opposite-Direction Pointers

6.  **A. Number of Pairs** (Codeforces Round #701 (Div. 2) Problem B): Count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ where $i < j$ such that the sum of the elements at these indices is within a given range. Sorting the array first and then using two pointers is the key.
7.  **A. Sum of Two Values** (CSES Problem Set): While not a Codeforces problem, this is a staple for the two-pointer approach and is a must-solve. It's often used as a warm-up for more complex problems.
8.  **B. Three Parts of the Array** (Codeforces Round #369 (Div. 2) Problem C): Find two non-empty non-overlapping subarrays with equal sums. You can use two pointers moving towards the middle of the array, one from each side.

### Other Two-Pointer Variations & Related Techniques

9.  **A. Merging Arrays** (Codeforces Educational Round 1 Problem A): Merge two sorted arrays into one. You can use two pointers, one for each array, to build the merged array.
10. **A. Sort the Array** (Codeforces Round #222 (Div. 2) Problem B): Determine if an array can become sorted by reversing just one subsegment. You can use two pointers to find the boundaries of the unsorted segment.
11. **B. Filya and Homework** (Codeforces Round #370 (Div. 2) Problem B): This problem involves finding if a set of numbers can be partitioned into three parts with a specific property. Sorting and using two pointers can help determine the partitions.

This video provides an excellent explanation of how to solve the "Flipping Game" problem using a sliding window approach, specifically Kadane's Algorithm, which is a key two-pointer concept.
