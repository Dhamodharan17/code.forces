Perfect 👍 two-pointer (a.k.a. sliding window) is a very common pattern in **Codeforces**.
I’ll give you a **hand-picked list of Codeforces problems** (in increasing order of difficulty), all solvable with two-pointers.

## 🔹 Beginner / Warm-up

1. [381A – Sereja and Dima](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/381/A) → simulate taking cards from ends.
2. [279B – Books](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/279/B) → longest subarray with sum ≤ t.
3. [276C – Little Girl and Maximum Sum](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/276/C) → difference array + sorting + two-pointers.
4. [6C – Alice, Bob and Chocolate](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/6/C) → prefix sums + two pointers moving inward.

## 🔹 Intermediate

    5. [580C – Kefa and Park](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/580/C) → dfs + two pointers for consecutive cats.
    6. [279C – Ladder](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/279/C) → preprocess increasing/decreasing segments, use two pointers to check queries.
    7. [1000B – Light It Up](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1000/B) → sweep + two pointers to maximize illuminated segments.
    8. [545C – Woodcutters](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/545/C) → greedy with pointers (move along trees).

## 🔹 Advanced / Practice

9. [1238D – AB-string](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1238/D) → two pointers to count substrings efficiently.
10. [558C – Amr and Chemistry](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/558/C) → reduce array with operations, solve with BFS + two pointers idea.
11. [1490F – Equalize the Array](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1490/F) → frequency counts + two pointers to balance.
12. [633A – Ebony and Ivory](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/633/A) → linear Diophantine, can be brute forced with two-pointers.

⚡ If you’re just starting, I recommend solving in this order:

* **279B – Books** → (classic sliding window, must solve!).
* **381A – Sereja and Dima**
* **6C – Alice, Bob and Chocolate**

Then move to harder ones.

👉 Do you want me to **explain a roadmap** (like 10 problems gradually from easy → medium → hard with hints) so you can master two-pointer technique step by step?
