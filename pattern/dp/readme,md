Awesome ðŸš€ â€” **Dynamic Programming (DP)** is one of the most important categories on Codeforces (and in Google-style interviews too ðŸ˜‰).
Iâ€™ll give you a **structured ladder** of DP problems from **easy â†’ medium â†’ hard**, so you can build skill step by step.

# ðŸ”¹ Level 1 â€“ Intro / Easy DP

(learn recurrence + memoization + bottom-up)

1. [282A â€“ Bit++](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/282/A) â†’ trivial (warm-up).
2. [467A â€“ George and Accommodation](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/467/A) â†’ greedy, but warm-up style.
3. [550C â€“ Divisibility by Eight](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/550/C) â†’ brute force but teaches state thinking.
4. [236A â€“ Boy or Girl](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/236/A) â†’ warm-up with strings.
5. [580A â€“ Kefa and First Steps](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/580/A) â†’ longest non-decreasing subarray (intro DP).
6. [118D â€“ Caesarâ€™s Legions](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/D) â†’ classic DP with constraints.

# ðŸ”¹ Level 2 â€“ Classic 1D/2D DP

1. [450A â€“ Jzzhu and Children](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/450/A) â†’ simulation with state.
2. [279B â€“ Books](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/279/B) â†’ two pointers but can think DP-style.
3. [1143A â€“ The Doors](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1143/A) â†’ prefix/suffix decisions.
4. [545C â€“ Woodcutters](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/545/C) â†’ interval DP.
5. [431C â€“ k-Tree](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/431/C) â†’ DP with mod.
6. [474D â€“ Flowers](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/474/D) â†’ DP with prefix sums.

# ðŸ”¹ Level 3 â€“ Medium DP (Classic Patterns)

1. [466C â€“ Number of Ways](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/466/C) â†’ prefix sums + DP.
2. [455A â€“ Boredom](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/455/A) â†’ house robber style DP.
3. [489C â€“ Given Length and Sum of Digits](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/489/C) â†’ digit DP.
4. [456A â€“ Laptops](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/456/A) â†’ sorting + DP decisions.
5. [877C â€“ Modulo Sum](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/877/C) â†’ DP on modulus states.

# ðŸ”¹ Level 4 â€“ Hard / Advanced DP

1. [219D â€“ Choosing Capital for Treeland](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/219/D) â†’ tree DP.
2. [118E â€“ Bertown roads](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/118/E) â†’ DFS + DP.
3. [687A â€“ NP-Hard Problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/687/A) â†’ bipartite check + DP.
4. [607A â€“ Chain Reaction](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/607/A) â†’ DP with binary search.
5. [1342C â€“ Yet Another Counting Problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1342/C) â†’ math + DP thinking.
6. [1512G â€“ Shortest Path with Constraints](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1512/G) â†’ state compression DP.

# âœ… Suggested Roadmap for You

Since you already solved \~330 LeetCode Qs and are prepping for Google, Iâ€™d recommend:

* **Start simple:** 580A, 545C, 431C â†’ warm-up with standard DP.
* **Move up:** 474D, 466C, 455A â†’ medium classics.
* **Advance:** 607A, 219D â†’ tree DP + state compression.
* **Master:** 489C (digit DP), 1512G (hard state DP).

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to prepare a **50-problem DP ladder from Codeforces** (easy â†’ medium â†’ hard, like topic-wise: knapsack, subsequences, digit DP, tree DP)?
