Solving five problems on a DSA topic by yourself and getting stuck on the other five is a common experience. Instead of immediately trying to solve another 10 problems on the same topic and risking getting stuck again, a more effective approach is to **change your strategy**. Don't just do more of the same; do something different to fill the gaps in your knowledge.

### ðŸ’¡ Why Your Current Approach Isn't Working

When you're stuck on a problem, it's often not because you haven't seen enough problems, but because you're missing a key insight or a specific technique. Simply grinding more problems without addressing this gap can lead to a cycle of frustration. This is like trying to lift a heavy object without knowing the right techniqueâ€”you'll just keep failing and getting tired.

### ðŸ§  A Better Approach to Break the Cycle

Instead of solving another 10 problems, try this structured approach to tackle the five you got stuck on.

#### Step 1: Analyze the Problems You Couldn't Solve

Don't just look at the solution. First, take a step back and think about **why you got stuck**. Ask yourself these questions:

* **Did you understand the problem constraints and edge cases?**
* **Could you come up with a brute-force solution, even if it wasn't efficient?**
* **What data structure or algorithm did you think might be relevant, and why did it not work?**
* **Was there a pattern you failed to recognize?**

This meta-analysis helps you identify your specific weaknesses, which could be anything from a lack of knowledge about a specific algorithm to a failure in problem-solving methodology.

#### Step 2: Seek Targeted Help

You don't need to solve the problems alone anymore. Use external resources to get unstuck.

* **Hints:** Look for hints that guide you toward the right approach without giving away the full solution. Many platforms (like LeetCode and HackerRank) offer hints.
* **Discussions:** Read through the discussion forums for the problem. Often, other users share their thought processes, which can be very insightful.
* **Video Explanations:** Watch a video explanation from a reputable source. Seeing someone else walk through the logic can be a game-changer. This is particularly helpful for topics that rely heavily on visualization, like dynamic programming or graph traversal.

#### Step 3: Implement and Understand the Solution

Once you have the solution or a solid understanding of the logic, don't just copy the code.

* **Write the Code Yourself:** Type out the code from scratch, even if you're looking at a solution. This builds muscle memory and helps you internalize the logic.
* **Trace the Code:** Manually trace the code with a simple example. Walk through the code line by line to understand how the data structures change and how the algorithm progresses. This is a powerful way to debug your own thinking. 

#### Step 4: Revisit and Practice

After you've successfully solved the five problems you were stuck on, it's time to test your newfound knowledge.

* **Solve Similar Problems:** Look for problems that are similar in nature to the ones you just solved. These are often labeled as "related problems" on platforms. Aim to solve 2-3 of these without any help.
* **Review:** Don't forget to periodically review the problems you've solved. Try to re-solve them a few weeks later to ensure the concepts stick.

### âœ… Summary of the New Plan

Instead of: **Solve 10 problems â†’ Get stuck on 5 â†’ Solve another 10**

Try this: **Solve 5 problems â†’ Get stuck on 5 â†’ Analyze and seek help on those 5 â†’ Master them â†’ Solve 2-3 similar problems to reinforce the concept**

This targeted approach will build a solid foundation and give you the confidence to tackle more difficult problems on your own. It's not about the quantity of problems you solve, but the **quality of your learning**.
